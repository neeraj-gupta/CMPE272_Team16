==============
The United States has thousands of universities and colleges known for their quality and numerous programs of study. Thousands of overseas students aspire to study in US universities for their better future. But lack of information and knowledge to get into the right university restrain them to get the full benefits. 
In this project, we have made a website named Fly US which act as a professional adviser guiding overseas student to search for the right university for them in US. It helps to understand the application process, prepare for required tests, learn about the student visa process and make a smooth transition to a US campus.
